# Modern Cmake BoilerPlate Example
Simple modern CMake project that creates a library that can be installed and found via find_package()

This repository is meant to give a simple example of how to use CMake (3.13+).  It is meant to serve as a simple project structure and build example.  
The code in this project is simple and not intended to be the focus of the repo.

Things to do:
  - Add tests
  - Continue to expand to show more re-life complex project structure
